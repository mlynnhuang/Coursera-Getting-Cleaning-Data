Data Dictionary in Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Lynn Huang, July 26, 2015

This document is written based on the information from the README.txt, and feature_info.txt and features.txt, activity_labels.txt tables bundled from the data from the below link.

In the features_info.txt, the following info displays

Feature Selection 


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'


My version of CodeBook

So in the dataset in the my R program, the column names for the train and test sets are corresponding to the names described in feature_info.txt and features.txt

1.for dataset, "xtraindat" and "xtestdat"

variables are created from each time domain,three-dimensionalsignal signals, e.g. tBodyAcc, or frequence domain three-dimensional signals, e.g. fBodyAcc, after FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) was applied to some of these signals

Column 555-561 related to 

angle()

which are the additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. 
These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

[555] "angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)"          "angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)"
[557] "angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)"     "angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)"

(Note, I think there is a typo in [555], gravity-->gravityMean)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. Additional columns are added to the train set and test set, in 
	"sxytraindata"  and "sxytestdata"

Three column names are added infront of 561 columns of "xtraindat" and "xtestdat"

"activityid" - activity id (from the activity_labels.txt)             
 "activityname" - activity name (from the description of the activity_labels.txt, e.g. WALKING)
"volunteerid" - subject identifier (from the subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt), the person who performs the experiments
